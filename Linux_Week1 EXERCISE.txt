1) Write shell commands for the following.

2) Create 11 subdirectories in your home directory under OSxxx.

mkdir Week1
mkdir Week2
mkdir Week3
mkdir Week4
mkdir Week5
mkdir Week6
mkdir Week7
mkdir Week8
mkdir Week9
mkdir Week10
mkdir Week11

3) Create subdirectory TestFolder under Week1.

- cd Week1
- mkdir TestFolder

4) Create 3 different empty files in the TestFolder.

- cd TestFolder
- touch f1.txt
- touch f2.txt
- touch f3.txt

5) Add different contents in each of them using vi editor. (say f1, f2 and f3)

- vi f1.txt
This is f1 file and the content is added using vi editor.

- vi f2.txt
This is f2 file and the content is added using vi editor.

- vi f3.txt
This is f3 file and the content is added using vi editor.

6) Move back to Week1 folder and copy f1 to this location.

- cd TestFolder
- cp f1.txt ../

7) Create one more file with the command listing the number of users and number of files.

- Number of files: ls -l | grep ^- | wc -l >> counts.txt
- Number of users: who | wc -l >> counts.txt

Output:
2
Number of files: 2
0
Number of users: 0

8) Check content of this file.

cat counts.txt

9) Use commands to list all the files which starts with either 'a' or 'A'.

ls -l [aA]*

10) Create a newfile called month_names and use sort command to sort them.

- vi month_names
January
February
March
April
May
June
July
August
September
October
November
December

- sort month_names
April
August
December
February
January
July
June
March
November
October
September

11) Display the first five and last five lines of a given file.

head -5 month_names && tail -5 month_names

12) Redirect the output of commands 'pwd', 'date' and 'ls' in succession to a file.

pwd >> succession && date >> succession && ls succession

Output:
/home/mobaxterm/Linux
Sun, Jan 21, 2024 8:56:42 PM
a1.txt
a2.txt
a3.txt
AA.txt
month_names
succession
aakanxa1
aakanxa2.... etc

12) Exercise for vi editor commands: (Refer to next page)

The core of the Linux system is the kernel. The kernel controls all of the hardware and software 
on the computer system, allocating hardware when necessary, and executing software when 
required.
***
If you’ve been following the Linux world at all, no doubt you’ve heard the name Linus Torvalds. 
Linus is the person responsible for creating the first Linux kernel software while he was a 
student at the University of Helsinki. He intended it to be a copy of the Unix system, at the time 
a popular operating system used at many universities.
***
After developing the Linux kernel, Linus released it to the Internet community and solicited 
suggestions for improving it. This simple process started a revolution in the world of computer 
operating systems. Soon Linus was receiving suggestions from students as well as professional 
programmers from around the world.

For the above exercise (Ex. xiii) perform the following editor operations:

a) Remove blank lines wherever the *** is found.

sed '/^\*\*\*/d' linux.txt > ubuntu.txt

b) Replace all occurences of the word "Linux" with "Ubuntu".

sed 's/Linux/Ubuntu/g' ubuntu.txt > linux.txt

c) Save and return to command line prompt.

:wq

d) Use command to view "Linux.txt" at the command prompt without using vi.

cat linux.txt

e) Rename "Linux.txt" with the name "Ubuntu.txt".

mv linux.txt ubuntu.txt

f) Make a copy of the same text file in the name "Linux1.txt" at command prompt.

cp Linux.txt Linux1.txt
